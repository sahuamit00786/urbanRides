        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Founded in 2018, UrbanRides started as a small venture with just a few
          bikes and a big dream. Our founders, avid bikers themselves, wanted to
          create a platform where people could easily rent bikes for short trips
          or long adventures. What started as a local initiative soon expanded
          across several cities, and today, UrbanRides boasts a fleet of
          thousands of bikes catering to customers nationwide.

          simplified booking systems, and a commitment to customer satisfaction,
          we’ve become a trusted name in the bike rental industry.
